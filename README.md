Vector class.

Define a vector that has properties:
    Magnitude
    Angle(s) in degrees (Theta, Phi).
    Direction or unit vector.

If two vectors operate, the dot (.) and cross (x) product are overridden to conform to the usual vector product operations.
   
The member "coordinate_system" indicates whether the vector is cartesian or spherical.
